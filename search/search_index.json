Version 7 is used by default.</p> <p>The intent is for fakeredis to act as though you're talking to a real redis server. It does this by storing the state internally. For example:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import fakeredis\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(version=6)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.set('foo', 'bar')\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.get('foo')\n'bar'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.lpush('bar', 1)\n1\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.lpush('bar', 2)\n2\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.lrange('bar', 0, -1)\n[2, 1]\n</code></pre> <p>The state is stored in an instance of <code>FakeServer</code>. If one is not provided at construction, a new instance is automatically created for you, but you can explicitly create one to share state:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import fakeredis\n&gt;&gt;&gt; server = fakeredis.FakeServer()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r1 = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r1.set('foo', 'bar')\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r2 = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r2.get('foo')\n'bar'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r2.set('bar', 'baz')\nTrue\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r1.get('bar')\n'baz'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r2.get('bar')\n'baz'\n</code></pre> <p>It is also possible to mock connection errors, so you can effectively test your error handling. Set the connected attribute of the server to <code>False</code> after initialization.</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import fakeredis\n&gt;&gt;&gt; server = fakeredis.FakeServer()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; server.connected = False\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.set('foo', 'bar')\nConnectionError: FakeRedis is emulating a connection error.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; server.connected = True\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r.set('foo', 'bar')\nTrue\n</code></pre> <p>Fakeredis implements the same interface as <code>redis-py</code>, the popular redis client for python, and models the responses of redis 6.x or 7.x.</p>"},{"location":"#async-redis","title":"async Redis","text":"<p>Async redis client is supported.

The following are differences that are unlikely to ever be fixed; there are also differences that are fixable (such as commands that do not support all features) which should be filed as bugs in GitHub.</p> <ul> <li>Hyperloglogs are implemented using sets underneath. This means that the <code>type</code> command will return the wrong answer,   you can't use <code>get</code> to retrieve the encoded value, and counts will be slightly different (they will in fact be exact).</li> <li> <p>When a command has multiple error conditions, such as operating on a key of the wrong type and an integer argument is   not well-formed, the choice of error to return may not match redis.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>incrbyfloat</code> and <code>hincrbyfloat</code> commands in redis use the C <code>long double</code> type, which typically has more   precision than Python's <code>float</code> type.</p> </li> <li> <p>Redis makes guarantees about the order in which clients blocked on blocking commands are woken up. Fakeredis does not   honor these guarantees.</p> </li> <li> <p>Where redis contains bugs, fakeredis generally does not try to provide exact bug compatibility. It's not practical for   fakeredis to try to match the set of bugs in your specific version of redis.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are a number of cases where the behavior of redis is undefined, such as the order of elements returned by set   and hash commands. Fakeredis will generally not produce the same results, and in Python versions before 3.6 may   produce different results each time the process is re-run.</p> </li> <li> <p>SCAN/ZSCAN/HSCAN/SSCAN will not necessarily iterate all items if items are deleted or renamed during iteration. They   also won't necessarily iterate in the same chunk sizes or the same order as redis. This is aligned with redis behavior   as can be seen in tests <code>test_scan_delete_key_while_scanning_should_not_returns_it_in_scan</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>DUMP/RESTORE will not return or expect data in the RDB format. Instead, the <code>pickle</code> module is used to mimic an opaque   and non-standard format.
